## Installation

### Requirements

**TypeScript**: Version 5.3.0 or higher is required. We recommend using the latest stable version for the best experience and type safety.

**Configuration**: Make sure you have `"strict": true` (or at least `"strictNullChecks": true`) enabled in your `tsconfig.json`:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "strict": true
  }
}
```
