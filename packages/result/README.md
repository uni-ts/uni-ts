# @uni-ts/result

**Type-safe error handling**

The `@uni-ts/result` package will help you handle errors in a more predictable way. Instead of throwing exceptions that can be missed or forgotten, Result types make error handling explicit and visible in your function signatures.

For more information, see the [Introduction](https://uni-ts.pages.dev/docs/result) page.
