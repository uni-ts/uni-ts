# @uni-ts/result

**Type-safe error handling**

The `@uni-ts/result` package will help you handle errors in a more predictable way. Instead of throwing exceptions that can be missed or forgotten, Result types make error handling explicit and visible in your function signatures.

To learn more about this package, see the [Documentation](https://uni-ts.dev/docs/result/).
