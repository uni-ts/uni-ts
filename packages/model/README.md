# @uni-ts/model

**Type-safe data modeling and validation**

The `@uni-ts/model` package provides a unified interface for creating type-safe data models that work seamlessly with validation libraries following the [Standard Schema interface](https://github.com/standard-schema/standard-schema) like [Zod](https://zod.dev), [Valibot](https://valibot.dev), or [ArkType](https://arktype.dev).

To learn more about this package, see the [Documentation](https://uni-ts.dev/docs/model/).
